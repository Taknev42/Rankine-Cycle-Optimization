# Rankine-Cycle-Optimization
A Thermodynamics course project on the topic of optimization of an ideal Rankine cycle using reheat and regeneration. The code was written using MATLAB and the Cantera Library.

Project Title: Optimization of an Ideal Rankine Cycle for Enhanced Efficiency

Project Overview
This project focuses on improving the performance of a power plant operating on a basic ideal Rankine cycle. The objective is to enhance the thermal efficiency and steam quality of the cycle while adhering to specific operational constraints.

Project Goals
Efficiency Improvement: Increase the thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle from the current 41% to over 46%.
Steam Quality Enhancement: Improve the steam quality at the condenser inlet from 76% to above 85%.
Maintain Operational Constraints:
Boiler Pressure: 15 MPa
Condenser Pressure: 10 kPa
Maximum Turbine Temperature: 500Â°C
Task Breakdown
Cycle Modification:

Analyze the current Rankine cycle and propose modifications to meet the efficiency and steam quality targets.
Ensure that the boiler and condenser pressures remain within the specified limits.
Document the modified cycle's thermal efficiency and steam quality.
Pressure Variation Analysis:

Vary the boiler pressure (Pb) within the range of 12 MPa to 15 MPa.
Vary the condenser pressure (Pc) within the range of 10 kPa to 5 kPa.
Plot the effects of these pressure variations on the thermal efficiency and net work output of the modified cycle.
